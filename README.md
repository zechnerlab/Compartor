# Compartor

Compartor is an automatic moment equation generator for stochastic compartment populations:
From a set of provided interaction rules, it derives the associated system of ODEs that describes the population statistics.
Equations can be exported as Python or Julia code.


## Installation

Install with `pip`
```
pip install compartor
```


## Getting started

A tutorial for the usage of Compartor is provided as Jupyter notebooks at https://github.com/zechnerlab/Compartor


## Publications

Compartor is based on the theoretical framework introduced by

Duso, L. and Zechner, C. (2020).
